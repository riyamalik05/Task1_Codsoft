# README: Titanic Survival Prediction

## Author: Riya Malik

## Batch: January A30

## Domain: Data Science

## Aim

The aim of this project is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on given features.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is imported from a CSV file, "archive.zip". The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including their survival status, class (Pclass), sex (Gender), and age (Age).

## Libraries Used

The following important libraries were used for this project:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
- sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder
- sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split
- sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression
